## Description
**R for Reproducible data wrangling**     
**What happens before the stats: the power of R Tidyverse for wrangling, cleaning, and exploring your data.**

**Rationale**: Most biologists use R for data analysis and visualization. But most still rely on spreadsheets to go from the raw data to data tables suited for specific uses (e.g., a statistical test or plotting). This makes analysis messy, unnecessarily frustrating, and, most importantly, not reproducible. Here we will learn how to do it all within the same workflow using the powerful and intuitive functions of the Tidyverse (includes ggplot!).

**Goal**: reproducible research & higher efficiency in data wrangling (& more fun!)

**Target audience**:
+ R novices
+ R intermediate users that are not familiar with the Tidyverse

**This workshop covers**:
+ The concept of reproducible research and the importance of always manipulating data through (R) scripts
+ Introduction to the powerful and versatile Tidyverse
+ Working example of **R script** (+ associated dummy **data** set) to simulate a data analysis workflow that covers the most useful functions to explore, check, correct, reshape, and visualize biological data

**This workshop does NOT cover**:
+ Download and installation of R and R Studio
+ Explanation of the basics of the R coding language
